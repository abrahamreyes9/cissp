# 2.5 Ensure appropriate asset retention (e.g., End-of-Life (EOL), End-of-Support (EOS))

To ensure appropriate asset retention, organizations can follow these best practices:

1. Establish clear policies and procedures for managing the end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) for all assets, including hardware, software, and other equipment.
2. Regularly review the inventory of assets to identify any items that are approaching EOL or EOS and plan for their replacement or disposal.
3. Communicate with vendors and suppliers to stay informed about EOL and EOS dates for purchased assets and plan accordingly.
4. Develop a system for tracking and monitoring the status of all assets to ensure they are replaced or disposed of in a timely manner.
5. Implement security measures to protect sensitive information and data on assets that are being retired or disposed of.
6. Conduct regular audits and assessments to ensure that assets are being managed and retained in accordance with established policies and procedures.
