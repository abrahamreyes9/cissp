# Labels

Labels = Objects have Labels assigned to them.&#x20;

* &#x20;The label is used to allow Subjects with the right clearance to access them.&#x20;
* &#x20;Labels are often more granular than just “Top Secret” they can be “Top Secret – Nuclear.”&#x20;

Clearance = Subjects have Clearance assigned to them.&#x20;

* A formal decision on a subject’s current and future trustworthiness.&#x20;
* The higher the clearance, the more in-depth the background checks should be (always in military, not always in the corporate world)

Objects have labels and subjects have clearances. The object labels used by many world governments are confidential, secret, and top-secret. According to Executive Order 12356—National Security Information:&#x20;

* “Top Secret” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.&#x20;
* “Secret” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security.&#x20;
* “Confidential” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security.

Private sector companies use labels such as “Internal Use Only” and “Company Proprietary” to categorize information
