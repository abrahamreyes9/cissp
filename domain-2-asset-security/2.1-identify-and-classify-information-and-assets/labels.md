# Labels

Objects have labels and subjects have clearances. The object labels used by many world governments are confidential, secret, and top-secret. According to Executive Order 12356—National Security Information:&#x20;

* “Top Secret” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.&#x20;
* “Secret” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security.&#x20;
* “Confidential” shall be applied to information, of which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security.

Private sector companies use labels such as “Internal Use Only” and “Company Proprietary” to categorize information
