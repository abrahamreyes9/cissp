# Data Remanence

Once the data is safely backed up or past its useful life, it needs to be deleted or purged from the digital media. However, such erasure actions may not completely wipe the data from the digital media. The possibility of residual data remains. Besides, in some systems, only the table entries for the data are removed and not the data itself until it is overwritten. Corporations regularly dispose of systems with digital media containing such residual data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Data that remains even after erasing or formatting digital media is called residual data and the property to retain such data is called data remanence. Data remanence is the residual data that remains when the data is not completely erased or destroyed. When the media is reused, this may result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. It is a good practice to **prevent media reuse** by physically destroying the media completely. In case of reuse, policies and procedures should be established to ensure that the data is destroyed completely.
