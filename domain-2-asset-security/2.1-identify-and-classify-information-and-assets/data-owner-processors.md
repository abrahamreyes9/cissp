# Data Owner/Processors

Data owners that pertain to privacy are the people identified in that record. The owner can provide consent to process or share the personal information to others, such as corporations. In such cases, the entity that processes, stores, or transmits the information on behalf of the owner is called a licensee

When a third-party vendor is engaged by the licensee to create, receive, maintain, or transmit personal information, such entities are called business associates or data processors.&#x20;

There are various privacy safeguard requirements pertaining to data processors in international laws.&#x20;

For example, in the USA, all the companies that are strictly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to adhere to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the GLBA privacy and safeguarding rules

All health care providers including health insurance companies and health care information clearing houses are subjected to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy and security rules. Similarly, all schools and institutions that receive funds from the department of education are subject to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).&#x20;

In all the preceding laws, the legal obligations are passed on to the data processors as well

### DATA CONTROLLERS AND DATA PROCESSORS

&#x20;Data controllers create and manage sensitive data within an organization. Human resources employees are often data controllers, as they create and manage sensitive data, such as salary and benefit data, reports from employee sanctions, etc. Data processors manage data on behalf of data controllers. An outsourced payroll company is an example of a data processor. Data processors manage payroll data, which is used to determine the amount to pay individual employees, on behalf of a data controller, such as an HR department.

### DATA COLLECTION LIMITATION

Organizations should collect the minimum amount of sensitive information that is required. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Collection Limitation Principle discusses data limitation: “There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.”2
