# Defence in depth

The concept of defense in depth refers to the practice of implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect a system or network from potential threats. The goal of defense in depth is to provide multiple lines of defense that can prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents, reducing the likelihood of a successful attack and minimizing the potential impact of any incidents that do occur.

Defense in depth involves implementing a variety of security controls and measures at different levels of a system or network, including physical security measures, access controls, encryption, and monitoring and detection systems. By implementing multiple layers of security, organizations can create a more resilient and secure environment that is better able to withstand attacks and protect against potential threats.

The ASCII art above shows four layers of security, representing physical security, access controls, encryption, and monitoring and detection systems.&#x20;

These four layers represent the multiple lines of defense that are implemented as part of the defense in depth approach.
