# Threat Modelling

Threat modeling is the process of identifying and analyzing potential security threats to a system, with the goal of developing strategies to mitigate or prevent those threats. Threat modeling involves breaking down a system into its component parts and identifying the vulnerabilities and risks that each component faces.&#x20;

Threats are ranked based on their likelihood and potential impact on the system, and strategies are developed to mitigate the most significant threats.&#x20;

Threat modeling can be used to assess the security of any system, from a single computer to a large network or even an entire organization. It is an important part of any comprehensive security program.

1. STRIDE: An acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege. STRIDE helps identify potential threats to a system and categorize them based on the types of attacks they represent.
2. TRIKE: An acronym for Threats, Risks, Impacts, Knowledge, and Expectations. TRIKE involves breaking down a system into its component parts, or "assets," and identifying the threats and risks that each component faces.
3. VAST: An acronym for Visualize, Analyze, Specify, and Test. VAST is a visual, interactive approach to threat modeling that involves creating a diagram or map of the relationships between components in a system.
4. PASTA: An acronym for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis. PASTA is a structured, iterative approach to threat modeling that involves simulating attacks on the system to identify potential vulnerabilities.
5. DREAD: An acronym for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability. DREAD is a simple, straightforward approach to threat modeling that involves ranking potential threats based on their potential impact and likelihood of being exploited.
