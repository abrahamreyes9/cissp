# DREAD

## DREAD

**DREAD** was previously used at Microsoft and OpenStack to assess threats against the organization. The mnemonic is to remember the risk rating for security threats using five categories. A score of 0 to 10 is given to each category, then the scores are added and divided by 5 to calculate the final risk score. The categories are:

* **D**amage – how bad would an attack be?
  * **0** = no damage
  * **10** = complete destruction
* **R**eproducibility – how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
  * **0** = impossible
  * **10** = easy and without authentication
* **E**xploitability – how much work is it to launch the attack?
  * **0** = advanced knowledge and tools
  * **10** = little knowledge, a web browser
* **A**ffected users – how many people will be affected?
  * **0** = none
  * **10** = all
* **D**iscoverability – how easy is it to discover the threat?
  * **0** = nearly impossible, source code or administrator access required
  * **10** = visible easily, from a web browser
