# STRIDE

### STRIDE

Microsoft developed the STRIDE threat model:

* Spoofing: an attack with the goal of gaining access to a target system through the use of falsified identity
* Tampering: any action resulting in unauthorized changes or manipulation of data, whether in transit or in storage
* Repudiation: the ability of a user or attacker to deny having performed an action or activity by maintaining plausible deniability
* Information Disclosure: the revelation or distribution of private, confidential, or controlled information to external or unauthorized entities
* Denial of Service (DoS): an attack that attempts to prevent authorized use of a resource. This can be done through flaw exploitation, connection overloading, or traffic flooding
* Elevation of privilege: an attack where a limited user account is transformed into an account with greater privileges, powers, and access
