# STRIDE

STRIDE is a threat modeling method that involves identifying and categorizing potential threats to a system based on the types of attacks they represent.&#x20;

Here are some key points about STRIDE:

* It is an acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege.
  * Spoofing: an attack with the goal of gaining access to a target system through the use of falsified identity
  * Tampering: any action resulting in unauthorized changes or manipulation of data, whether in transit or in storage
  * Repudiation: the ability of a user or attacker to deny having performed an action or activity by maintaining plausible deniability
  * Information Disclosure: the revelation or distribution of private, confidential, or controlled information to external or unauthorized entities
  * Denial of Service (DoS): an attack that attempts to prevent authorized use of a resource. This can be done through flaw exploitation, connection overloading, or traffic flooding
  * Elevation of privilege: an attack where a limited user account is transformed into an account with greater privileges, powers, and access
* It is a structured, systematic approach to identifying potential threats to a system and categorizing them based on the types of attacks they represent.
* For each potential threat, STRIDE helps identify the potential impact on the system and the likelihood of the threat being realized.
* Once threats have been identified and categorized, strategies can be developed to mitigate or prevent them from occurring.
* STRIDE can be used to assess the security of any system, from a single computer to a large network or even an entire organization.
* It is particularly useful for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in complex, interconnected systems.
