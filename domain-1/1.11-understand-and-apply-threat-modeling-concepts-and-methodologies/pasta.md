# PASTA

PASTA is a threat modeling method that involves iteratively reviewing and refining a system's design to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Here are some key points about PASTA:

* It is an acronym for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.
* It is a structured, iterative approach to threat modeling that involves reviewing and refining a system's design to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* PASTA involves simulating attacks on the system to identify potential vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate those vulnerabilities.
* The system's design is then reviewed and refined based on the results of the attack simulations, and the process is repeated until all potential vulnerabilities have been addressed.
* PASTA can be used to assess the security of any system, from a single computer to a large network or even an entire organization.
* It is particularly useful for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in complex, interconnected systems.

Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a seven-stage threat modeling methodology it is a risk-centric threat-modeling framework developed in 2012. It contains seven stages, each with multiple activities:

The seven steps of PASTA:

* Stage I: Definition of the Objectives (DO) for the Analysis of Risk.
* Stage II: Definition of the Technical Scope (DTS)
* Stage III: Application Decomposition and Analysis (ADA)
* Stage IV: Threat Analysis (TA)
* Stage V: Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis (WVA)
* Stage VI: Attack Modeling and Simulation (AMS)
* Stage VII: Risk Analysis and Management (RAM)

Each stage of PASTA has a specific list of objectives to achieve and deliverables to produce in order to complete the stage.
