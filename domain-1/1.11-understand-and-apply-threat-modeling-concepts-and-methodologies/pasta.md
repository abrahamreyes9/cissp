### PASTA

Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a seven-stage threat modeling methodology it is a risk-centric threat-modeling framework developed in 2012. It contains seven stages, each with multiple activities:

The seven steps of PASTA:

* Stage I: Definition of the Objectives (DO) for the Analysis of Risk.
* Stage II: Definition of the Technical Scope (DTS)
* Stage III: Application Decomposition and Analysis (ADA)
* Stage IV: Threat Analysis (TA)
* Stage V: Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis (WVA)
* Stage VI: Attack Modeling and Simulation (AMS)
* Stage VII: Risk Analysis and Management (RAM)

Each stage of PASTA has a specific list of objectives to achieve and deliverables to produce in order to complete the stage.
