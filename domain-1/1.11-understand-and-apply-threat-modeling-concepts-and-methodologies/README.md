# 1.11 Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies

**Threat Modeling**: security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed. It can be performed as a proactive measure during design and development or as a reactive measure once a product has been deployed. Threat modeling identifies the potential harm, the probability of occurrence, the priority of concern, and the means to eradicate or reduce the threat.

* Microsoft uses the **Security Development Lifecycle** (SDL) with the motto: "Secure by design, secure by default, secure in deployment and communication." It has two objectives:
  * Reduce the number of security-related design and coding defects
  * Reduce the severity of any remaining defects
* A defensive approach to threat modeling takes place during the early stages of development; the method is based on predicting threats and designing specific defenses during the coding and crafting process. Security solutions are more cost-effective in this phase than later. This concept should be considered a proactive approach to threat management
