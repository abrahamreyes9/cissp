# TRIKE

TRIKE is a threat modeling method that involves breaking down a system into components, identifying and ranking threats, and developing strategies to mitigate those threats. Here are some key points about TRIKE:

* It is an acronym for Threats, Risks, Impacts, Knowledge, and Expectations.
* It is a structured, iterative approach to identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities in a system.
* It involves breaking down a system into its component parts, or "assets," and identifying the threats and risks that each component faces.
* Threats are ranked based on their likelihood and potential impact on the system, and strategies are developed to mitigate the most significant threats.
* TRIKE can be used to assess the security of any system, from a single computer to a large network or even an entire organization.
* It is particularly useful for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in complex, interconnected systems.

Trike is using threat models as a risk-management tool. Used to satisfy the security auditing process. Threat models are based on a “requirements model.” The requirements model establishes the stakeholder-defined “acceptable” level of risk assigned to each asset class. Analysis of the requirements model yields a threat model from which threats are enumerated and assigned risk values.&#x20;

The completed threat model is used to construct a risk model based on assets, roles, actions, and calculated risk exposure.

Understanding threats to the organization allow the documentation of potential attack vectors. Diagramming can be used to list various technologies under threat
