# VAST

VAST is a threat modeling method that involves creating visual diagrams of a system to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. Here are some key points about VAST:

* It is an acronym for Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST)&#x20;
* It is a visual, diagram-based approach to identifying potential threats to a system and understanding how they might impact the system.
* VAST involves creating diagrams of a system's components and connections, and using these diagrams to identify potential vulnerabilities and the potential impact of threats on the system.
* Once threats have been identified, strategies can be developed to mitigate or prevent them from occurring.
* VAST can be used to assess the security of any system, from a single computer to a large network or even an entire organization.
* It is particularly useful for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in complex, interconnected systems.

Vast is a threat modeling concept based on Agile project management and programming principles.

Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) is a threat modeling concept that integrates threat and risk management into an Agile programming environment on a scalable basisPart of the job of the security team is to identify threats, using different methods:

* Focus on attackers: this is a useful method in specific situations. For example, suppose that a developer’s employment is terminated. After extracting data from the developer’s computer, a determination is made that the person was disgruntled and angry. Understanding this situation as a possible threat, allows mitigation steps to be taken
* Focus on assets: an organization’s most valuable assets are likely to be targeted by attackers
* Focus on software: organizations that develop applications in house, and can be viewed as part of the threat landscape. The goal isn’t to identify every possible attack, but instead to focus on the big picture, identifying risks and attack vectors
