# VAST

Vast is a threat modeling concept based on Agile project management and programming principles.

Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) is a threat modeling concept that integrates threat and risk management into an Agile programming environment on a scalable basisPart of the job of the security team is to identify threats, using different methods:

* Focus on attackers: this is a useful method in specific situations. For example, suppose that a developer’s employment is terminated. After extracting data from the developer’s computer, a determination is made that the person was disgruntled and angry. Understanding this situation as a possible threat, allows mitigation steps to be taken
* Focus on assets: an organization’s most valuable assets are likely to be targeted by attackers
* Focus on software: organizations that develop applications in house, and can be viewed as part of the threat landscape. The goal isn’t to identify every possible attack, but instead to focus on the big picture, identifying risks and attack vectors
