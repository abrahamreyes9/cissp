The three main goals of information security are

## **Confidentiality**&#x20;

* Prevents unauthorized disclosure&#x20;
* Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information&#x20;
* Confidentiality aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring secrets remain secret. Data breaches serve as a prime example of a breach of confidentiality
* Secrets remain secret while confidentiality is maintained

## **Integrity**&#x20;

* Prevents unauthorized alteration&#x20;
* Guarding against improper information modification or destruction includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity
* Integrity focuses on the prevention of unauthorized modification of assets, whether data or systems. Unauthorized alteration of a system's configuration through malware installation would be a system integrity violation
* This applies to both data and systems
* Malware installation would be a violation of a system's integrity

## **Availability**&#x20;

* Ensures authorized access
* Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information by authorized users
* Availability tries to ensure the required access to resources remains possible.&#x20;
* Integrity ensures that data has not been altered without authorization. Message hashes, checksums, change control, and auditing are all methods for ensuring the integrity
* Ransomware and denial of service (DoS) attacks represent obvious breaches of availability

## Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy (1)&#x20;

Confidentiality ensures that only approved people and processes have appropriate access to information. Labels are often used to define the level of controls needed to ensure confidentiality. The Federal government commonly uses FOUO (For Official Use Only), Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret.&#x20;

In the commercial sector, information is sometimes designated as proprietary or as trade secrets, where disclosure of the data would damage the company's profits in some way and allow competitors to gain an unfair competitive advantage.&#x20;

Integrity ensures that data has not been altered without authorization. Message hashes, checksums, change control, and auditing are all methods for ensuring the integrity

### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy (2)&#x20;

Availability refers to the ability to access information whenever it is needed. Availability can be denied by either preventing access to the information, or by actually destroying the data.&#x20;

Denial of Service attacks, hostile code, EMI, power outages, or brownouts is just a few examples of threats that could affect availability.

It is important to note that natural disasters can lead to the unavailability of a network or facility. The important thing to remember is that these events do not have to be intentional.&#x20;

Accidents or unintentional events can cause a loss of availability for an organization.

## Concepts and terminology

* Confidentiality ≠ disclosure&#x20;
* Integrity ≠ alteration&#x20;
* Availability ≠ destruction&#x20;
* Identification&#x20;
* Authentication&#x20;
* Authorization&#x20;
* Accountability
