## Identification (Who you say you are)

* Identification means in which the user claims Identity
* Identification provides a weak and unproven claim of identity&#x20;
* Providing a username would be an example of identification&#x20;
* Requires proof (authentication) prior to being granted access (authorization) to controlled data.

## Authentication (Prove who you are)

* Authentication establishes and proves users' Identity&#x20;
* Authentication serves as proof that a user's identity claim was legitimate.&#x20;
* Stronger authentication implies higher integrity means of proof or multiple methods of proof
* **Something you know - Type 1** \
  ****Authentication (passwords, passphrase, PIN, etc.).
* **Something you have - Type 2** \
  Authentication (ID, passport, smart card, token, a cookie on PC, etc.).&#x20;
* **Something you are - Type 3** \
  Authentication (and Biometrics) (Fingerprint, iris scan, facial geometry, etc.).

## Authorization (What are you allowed to access)

* Authorization rights, and permissions granted to an individual&#x20;
* Authorization proceeds after successful authentication and determines what an authenticated user can do

## Auditing / Auditing (Tracing action to identity)

* Auditing recording a log of the events and activities related to the system and subjects&#x20;
* Accountability log files to check for compliance and violations in order to hold subjects accountable for their action
* Accountability details the interactions performed by individuals. For example, audit logs could be generated, which could be used to hold users accountable for their actions
* Accountability details the interactions performed by individuals&#x20;
* Audit logs could be generated allowing users to be held accountable for their documented actions

## Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (1)

The difference between identification and authentication is claiming to be someone and providing proof you are who you say you are.&#x20;

We often use our driver's licenses as a means of authentication in everyday life. User IDs are a common form of identification. Schemes for assigning user IDs should be logical, but not necessarily easily guessed by those outside the organization.

&#x20;In many organizations, user IDs are paired with passwords, so if outsiders can figure out the user ID, they are on their way to gaining access to your systems.&#x20;

Passwords, as mentioned, are a method of authentication, or verifying a user's identity.

## Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (2)&#x20;

Authorization determines which users or groups of users should have access to what group of information.&#x20;

This is usually based on the services and data a person requires to do their job or their "need to know."&#x20;

Users should not have the same level of access to the network as system administrators. Accountability makes you responsible for your actions.&#x20;

Having auditing enabled is not enough to ensure accountability.&#x20;

Someone must actually review the logs and identify violations. Violations must be reported to the appropriate authorities, and those authorities must then enforce the organization's rules.



A good way to differentiate authenticity and nonrepudiation is that authenticity proves to you that youâ€™re talking to a given person at a given point in time

Nonrepudiation proves to anyone that a given person did or said something in the past\
