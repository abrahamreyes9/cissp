* We implement multiple overlapping security controls to protect an asset.&#x20;
*   This applies both to physical and logical controls.&#x20;

    * To get to a server, you may have to go through multiple locked doors, security guards, and man traps.&#x20;
    * To get to the data, you may need to get past firewalls, routers, switches, the server, and the security of the application.&#x20;
    * &#x20;Each step may have multiple security controls

    &#x20;
* No single security control secures an asset.&#x20;
* By implementing Defense in Depth, you improve your organizationâ€™s Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
