# Types of Authentication

There are four main categories of authentication:&#x20;

* Something you know (passwords or phrases)&#x20;
* Something you have (such as a token, smart card, or badge)&#x20;
* Something you are (biometrics: fingerprints, retina scans, voice, palm scans, hand geometry)&#x20;
* Someplace you are (such as GPS) Using two of these categories is known as two-factor or multi-factor authentication

Using two of these categories is known as two-factor or multi-factor authentication

Using more than one of these three categories strengthens the level of security.&#x20;

When using biometrics, consider the Crossover Error Rate (CER) or the percentage of the False Rejection Rate (FRR) compared to the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Ideally, false rejections and acceptances should be very low
