# Employment candidate screening

Background verification checks are primarily used in employment candidate screening processes. They may include the following:

1. Character references to evaluate the personal traits of the applicant. Best practice guidelines indicate character references from at least two entities, such as from business and personnel.
2. Completeness and accuracy of the applicant's curriculum vitae and the verification of claimed academic and professional qualifications are critical checks in the screening process.
3. Identity checks by verifying identification documents.
4. Checking criminal records as well as credit checks.
