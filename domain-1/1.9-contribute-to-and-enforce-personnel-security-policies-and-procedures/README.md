# 1.9 Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures

Personnel security policies concern people associated with the organization, such as employees, contractors, and consultants. These policies encompass the following:&#x20;

* Screening processes to validate security requirements&#x20;
* Understanding their security responsibilities&#x20;
* Understanding their suitability to security roles&#x20;
* Reducing the risk of theft, fraud, or the misuse of facilities

People are often considered the weakest element in any security solution. No matter what physical or logical controls are deployed, humans can discover ways of to avoid them, circumvent or subvert them, or disable them. Malicious actors are routinely targeting users with phishing and spear phishing campaigns, social engineering, and other types of attacks. Everybody is a target. And once attackers compromise an account, they can use that entry point to move around the network and elevate their privileges. However, people can also become a key security asset when they are properly trained and are motivated to protect not only themselves but the security of the organization as well.

The following strategies can reduce your risk:

* **Candidate screening and hiring**: To properly plan for security, you must have standards in place for job descriptions, job classification, work tasks, job responsibilities, prevention of collusion, candidate screening, background checks, security clearances, employment agreements, and nondisclosure agreements. Screening employment candidates thoroughly is a key part of the hiring process. Be sure to conduct a full background check that includes a criminal records check, job history verification, education verification, certification validation and confirmation of other accolades when possible. Additionally, all references should be contacted.
* **Employment agreements and policies**: An employment agreement specifies job duties, expectations, rate of pay, benefits and information about termination. Sometimes, such agreements are for a set period (for example, in a contract or short-term job). Employment agreements facilitate termination when needed for an underperforming employee. The more information and detail in an employment agreement, the less risk (risk of a wrongful termination lawsuit, for example) the company has during a termination proceeding. For example, a terminated employee might take a copy of their email with them without thinking of it as stealing, but they are less likely to do so if an employment agreement or another policy document clearly prohibits it.
* example employee agreements:
  * non-compete
  * codes of conduct such as an acceptable use policy (AUP), which defines what is and isn’t acceptable acitivty, practice, or use for company equipemnt and resources
  * nondisclosure agreement (NDA), which is a doc used to protect confidential information from being disclosed by a current or former employee
* **Onboarding, transfers and termination processes**:
  * onboarding: process of bringing a new employee into the organization
  * creating documented processes allowing the new employee to be intgrated quickly and consistently
  * transfer: an employee moves from one job to another, likely requiring adjusted account access to maintain appropriate least privilege
  * termination or offboarding: offboarding is the removal of an employee’s identity from the IAM system, once that person has left the oranization; can also be an element used when an employee transfers into a new role
  * whether cordial or abrupt, the ex-employee should be escorted off the premises and not allowed to return
* **Vendor, consultant, contractor agreements and controls**
  * organizations commonly outsource many IT functions, particularly data center hosting, contact-center support, and application development.
  * Info security policies and procedures must address outsourcing secuity and the use of service providers, vendors and consultants. Access control, document exchange and review, maintenance, on-site assessment, process and policy review, and service level agreements (SLAs) are examples of outsourcing security considerations
* **Compliance policy requirements**:
  * compliance is the act of confirming or adhering to rules, policies, regulations, standards, or requirements
  * on a personnel level, compliance is related to individual employees following company policies and procedures
  * employees need to be trained on company standards as defined in the security policy and remain in compliance with any contractual obligations (e.g. with PCI DSS)
  * compliacne is a form of administrative or managerial security control
  * compliance enforcement is the application of sanctions or consequences for failing to follow policy, training, best practices, or regulations
* **Privacy policy requirements**:
  * Personally identifiable information (PII) about employees, partners, contractors, customers and other people should be stored in a secure way, accessible only to those who require the information to perform their jobs.
  * Organizations should maintain a documented privacy policy which outlines the type of data covered by the policy and who the policy applies to. Employees and contractors should be required to read and agree to the privacy policy upon hire and on a regular basis thereafter (such as annually)
