# Employment termination processes

Employee termination processes have to be in accordance with the established security policies and practices. The primary objective of the process is to ensure that employees, contractors, and third-party users exit or change employment as per established procedures without compromising security. The procedures may include termination of responsibilities, return of assets, removal of access rights, and so on.
