# 1.8 Identify, analyze, and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements

Business Continuity Planning (BCP) involves assessing the risk to organizational processes and creating policies, plans, and procedures to minimize the impact those risks might have on the organization if they were to occur.

Business continuity planning conducts a business impact assessment and then implements controls designed to keep the business running during adverse circumstances

BCP is used to maintain the continuous operation of a business in the event of an emergency, with a goal to implement a combination of policies, procedures, and processes Business continuity requires a lot of planning and preparation. The actual implementation of business continuity processes occurs quite infrequently. The primary facets of business continuity are resilience (within a data center and between sites or data centers), recovery (if a service becomes unavailable, you need to recover it as soon as possible), and contingency (a last resort in case resilience and recovery prove ineffective)

## BCP vs DR

* BCP activities are typically strategically focused at a high level and center themselves on business processes and operations.
* DR plans tend to be more tactical and describe technical activities such as recovery sites, backups, and fault tolerance.

The overall goal of BCP is to provide a quick, calm, and efficient response in the event of an emergency and to enhance a company's ability to recover from a disruptive event promptly.

The BCP process has four main steps:

* **Project scope and planning**: Developing the project scope and plan starts with gaining the support of the management team, making a business case (cost/benefit analysis, regulatory or compliance reasons, etc.), and gaining approval to move forward. Next, you need to form a team with representatives from the business as well as IT. Then you are ready to begin developing the plan. Start with a business continuity policy statement, then conduct a business impact analysis (see next item), and then develop the remaining components: preventive controls, relocation, the actual continuity plan, testing, training, and maintenance)
* **Business impact analysis (BIA)**: Identify the systems and services that the business relies on and assess the impacts that a disruption or outage would cause, including the impacts on business processes like accounts receivable and sales. You also need to figure out which systems and services you need to get things running again (think foundational IT services such as the network and directory, which many other systems rely on). Finally, prioritize the order in which critical systems and services are recovered or brought back online. As part of the BIA, establish the **recovery time objectives** (RTOs) (how long it takes to recover), the **recovery point objectives** (RPOs) (the maximum tolerable data loss), and **maximum tolerable downtime** (MTD), along with the costs of downtime and recovery
* **Continuity planning**: The first two phases of the BCP process (project scope and planning and the business impact analysis) focus on determining how the BCP process will work and prioritizing the business assets that you must protect against interruption. The next phase of BCP development, continuity planning, focuses on developing and implementing a continuity strategy to minimize the impact realized risks might have on protected assets.

There are two primary subtasks involved in continuity planning:

* Strategy development
* Provisions and processes
* Approval and implementation

The goal of this process is to create a **continuity of operations plan** (COOP), which focuses on how an organization will carry out critical business functions beginning shortly after a disruption occurs and extending up to one month of sustained operations.

The top priority of BCP and DRP is people. Primarily to get people out of harm's way, and then address IT recovery and restoration issues.
