# 1.7 Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards, procedures, and guidelines

Policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines form a quartet of organizational mechanisms in protecting information:

The top tier of a formalized hierarchical organization security documentation is the security policy. A security policy is a document that defines the scope of security needed by the organization and discusses the assets that require protection and the extent to which security solutions should go to provide the necessary protections. It defines the strategic security objectives, vision, and goals and outlines the security framework of the organization.&#x20;

**Acceptable User Policy**: the AUP is a commonly produced document that exists as part of the overall security documentation infrastructure. This policy defines a level of acceptable performance and expectations of behavior and activity. Failure to comply with the policy may result in job action warnings, penalties, or termination.

A policy needs to be technology and solution independent. It must outline the goals and missions, but not tie the organization to specific ways of accomplishing them.

Organizational policy:&#x20;

* Acceptable use policy
* Risk management policy&#x20;
* Vulnerability management policy&#x20;
* Data protection policy&#x20;
* Access control policy&#x20;
* Business continuity policy&#x20;
* Log aggregation and auditing policy&#x20;
* Personnel security policy&#x20;
* Physical security policy&#x20;
* Secure application development policy&#x20;
* Change control policy&#x20;
* E-mail policy&#x20;
* Incident response policies

**Security Standards, Baselines, and Guidelines**

Once the main security policies are set, the remaining security documentation can be crafted from these policies.\

* **Policies**: these are high-level documents, usually written by the management team. Policies are mandatory. A policy might provide requirements, but not the steps for implementation
  * Policies generally fall into one of the following categories:&#x20;
    * **Regulatory** This type of policy ensures that the organization is following standards set by specific industry regulations (HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, PCI DSS, etc). It is very detailed and specific to a type of industry. It is used in financial institutions, healthcare facilities, public utilities, and other government-regulated industries.&#x20;
    * **Advisory** This type of policy strongly advises employees as to which types of behaviors and activities should and should not take place within the organization. It also outlines possible ramifications if employees do not comply with the established behaviors and activities. This policy type can be used, for example, to describe how to handle medical or financial information.
    * **Informative** This type of policy informs employees of certain topics. It is not an enforceable policy, but rather one that teaches individuals about specific issues relevant to the company. It could explain how the company interacts with partners, the companyâ€™s goals and mission, and a general reporting structure in different situations
* **Standards**: more descriptive than policies, standards define compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls, uniformly implemented throughout the organization

{% hint style="info" %}
The term standard has more than one meaning in our industry. Internal documentation that lays out rules that must be followed is a standard. But sometimes, best practices, as in the ISO/IEC 27000 series, are referred to as standards because they were developed by a standards body. And as we will see later, we have specific technologic standards, as in IEEE 802.11. You need to understand the context of how this term is used. The CISSP exam will not try and trick you on this word; just know that the industry uses it in several different ways
{% endhint %}

* **Baseline**: defines a minimum level of security that every system throughout the organization must meet. Baselines are usually system specific and refer to industry/government standards. As an example, a baseline for server builds would be a list of configuration areas that should be applied to every server that is built. A Group Policy object (GPO) in a Windows network is sometimes used to comply with standards. Configuration management solutions can also help you establish baselines and spot configurations that are not in alignment

{% hint style="info" %}
Baselines that are not technology oriented should be created and enforced within organizations as well. For example, a company can mandate that while in the facility all employees must have a badge with a picture ID in view at all times. It can also state that visitors must sign in at a front desk and be escorted while in the facility. If these rules are followed, then this creates a baseline of protection
{% endhint %}

* **Guideline**: offers recommendations on how standards and baselines should be implemented & serves as an operational guide for security professionals and users. Guidelines are flexible and can be customized for unique systems or conditions. They state which security mechanism should be deployed instead of prescribing a specific product or control. They are not compulsory
* **Procedure** (or Standard Operating Procedure or SOP): a detailed, step-by-step how-to doc that describes the exact actions necessary to implement a specific security mechanism, control, or solution
