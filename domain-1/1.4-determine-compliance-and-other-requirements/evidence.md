# Evidence

Evidence: How you obtain and handle evidence is **VERY** important.&#x20;

### Types of evidence:&#x20;

* **Real Evidence**: Tangible and physical objects in IT Security: Hard disks, USB drives – NOT the data on them.&#x20;
* **Direct Evidence:** Testimony from a firsthand witness, what they experienced with their 5 senses.&#x20;
* **Circumstantial Evidence:** Evidence to support circumstances for a point or other evidence.&#x20;
* **Collaborative Evidence**: Supports facts or elements of the case: not a fact on its own, but supports other facts.&#x20;
* **Hearsay**: Not first-hand knowledge – normally inadmissible in a case.
  * **Computer-generated records** - For us, that means log files are considered hearsay, but case law and updates to the Federal Rule of Evidence have changed that.&#x20;

Rule 803 provides for the admissibility of a record or report that was:&#x20;

_“made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data compilation.”_&#x20;

**Best Evidence Rule** – The courts prefer the best evidence possible.&#x20;

* Evidence should be accurate, complete, relevant, authentic, and convincing.&#x20;

**Secondary Evidenc**e – This is common in cases involving IT.&#x20;

* Logs and documents from the systems are considered secondary evidence
