# Contractual, legal, industry standards, and regulatory requirements

There are three categories under common law that are generally established:

1. **Regulatory law**, also called Administrative law, primarily deals with the regulations of administrative agencies of the government.
2. **Criminal law** deals with the violations of government laws. Criminal laws are filed by government agencies against an individual or an organization. The punishment under criminal laws includes imprisonment as well as financial penalties.
3. **Civil law** deals with lawsuits filed by private parties, such as corporations or individuals. Punishments under this law are financial or punitive damages or both

Understand the difference between criminal, civil, and administrative law.

* Criminal law: protects society against acts that violate the basic principles we believe in. Violations of criminal law are prosecuted by federal and state governments
* Civil Law laws are legal systems based on religious principles. Examples include Hindu, Islam, and Christian laws. Civil Law is a legal system based on codes and legislative statutes as opposed to common law. France, Germany, and many other countries in the world follow civil law. Hence, there is a civil law category in the common law system and a civil law system itself
* Civil law: provides the framework for the transaction of business between people and organizations. Violations of civil law are brought to the court and argued by the two affected parties&#x20;
* Statutory law, a legislative statute, or statute law is a legal system that is set down by the legislature or executive branch of the government. Statutory law under certain instances is also termed codified law.&#x20;
* Religions are legal systems based on religious principles. Examples include Hindu, Islam, and Christian laws
* Customary Law, mostly handles personal conduct and patterns of behavior and it is founded in traditions and customs of the area or region.&#x20;
