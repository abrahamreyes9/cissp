# Risk

Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given threat source’s exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization”-NIST SP 800-30.

Risk management - systematic application of management policies, procedures and practices to the activities of communicating, consulting, establishing the context and identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and reviewing risk.

Threats exploit vulnerabilities creating risk.

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing threats and risks. Risk assessments are used to identify the risks that might impact your particular environment.

* A risk is generally defined as the probability that an event will occur.&#x20;
* A threat, which is defined as an action or occurrence that could result in the breach, outage, or corruption of a system by exploiting known or unknown vulnerabilities.
* The goal of any risk management plan is to remove risks when possible and to minimize the consequences of risks that cannot be eliminated.

### **Risk Mitigation and Controls**

Risk has four essential control groups, namely:

1. Risk reduction - Controls are used to reduce the likelihood/impact of the risk or minimise loss.
2. Risk avoidance - Removing the threat by using alternate behaviour to end exposure.
3. Risk transfer - Pass risk onto 3rd party such as an insurance company.
4. Risk retention/acceptance - accepting the risk outcome as necessary to continuing the business goals and confirming monetary funds are available if required.

The controls are classified as Directive, deterrent, preventive, compensating, detective, corrective, recovery. Example of which include:

1. Technical controls - Authentication, access control, encryption, etc.
2. Procedural controls - Security awareness, training, etc.
3. Physical controls - Fences, doors, fire suppression, etc.
4. Legal, regulatory and compliance - Security policies, regulations, etc.
