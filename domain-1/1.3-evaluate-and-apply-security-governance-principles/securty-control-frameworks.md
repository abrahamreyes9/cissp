# Securty control frameworks

To support the information security strategy and the mission, control frameworks are established by the organization. Such frameworks contain controls under three broad categories, namely, management, administrative, and technical

Security frameworks provide templates for security activities. These include COBIT, NIST CSF, and ISO 27001/2

## Risk:&#x20;

• **NIST RMF** The Risk Management Framework, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is composed of three interrelated NIST Special Publications (SPs): 800-39, 800-37, and 800-30.&#x20;

• **ISO/IEC 27005** Focused on risk treatment, this joint International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission framework is best used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 27000 series standards. \

• **OCTAVE** The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation framework, developed at Carnegie Mellon University, is focused on risk assessment.&#x20;

• **FAIR** The FAIR Institute’s Factor Analysis of Information Risk framework focuses on more precisely measuring the probabilities of incidents and their impacts.&#x20;

## Security Program

• **ISO/IEC 27000 series** This is a series of international standards on how to develop and maintain an information security management system (ISMS), developed by ISO and IEC.&#x20;

• **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** Driven by the need to secure government systems, NIST developed this widely used and comprehensive framework for risk-driven information security.&#x20;

## Security Controls

&#x20;• **NIST SP 800-53** This NIST publication provides a catalog of controls and a process for selecting them in order to protect U.S. federal systems.&#x20;

• **CIS Controls** The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls framework is one of the simplest approaches for companies of all sizes to select and implement the right controls.

• **COBIT 2019** This is a business framework to allow for IT enterprise management and governance that was developed by ISACA.&#x20;

## Enterprise Architecture

• **Zachman Framewor**k This is a model for the development of enterprise architectures, developed by John Zachman.&#x20;

• **TOGAF** The Open Group Architecture Framework is a model and methodology for the development of enterprise architectures

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

• **DoDAF** The U.S. Department of Defense Architecture Framework was developed to ensure interoperability of systems to meet military mission goals.&#x20;

• **SABSA** The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture model and methodology for the development of information security enterprise architectures was developed by the SABSA Institute.
