# Organizational roles and responsibilities

Information security is everyone's responsibility in any organization. Specific security roles and responsibilities are to be considered from the security governance perspective.&#x20;

Hence, the information security responsibilities of the board of directors/trustees, executives, steering committee, and chief information security officer are important at the management level.

## Why So Many Roles?&#x20;

Most organizations will not have all the roles previously listed, but what is important is to build an organizational structure that contains the necessary roles and map the correct security responsibilities to them.&#x20;

This structure includes clear definitions of responsibilities, lines of authority and communication, and enforcement capabilities.&#x20;

A clear-cut structure takes the mystery out of who does what and how things are handled in different situations

Senior management always carries the ultimate responsibility for the organization
