**Strategic Plan**\
****A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the organizationâ€™s security purpose. It defines the security function and aligns it to the goals, mission, and objectives of the organization

**Tactical Plan**\
****The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan, or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events.

**Operational Plan**\
****An operational plan is a short-term, highly detailed plan based on strategic and tactical plans. It is valid or useful only for a short time

Security is a continuous process. Thus, the activity of security management planning may have a definitive initiation point, but its tasks and work are never fully accomplished or complete.&#x20;

Effective security plans focus attention on specific and achievable objectives, anticipate change and potential problems, and serve as a basis for decision-making for the entire organization.&#x20;
