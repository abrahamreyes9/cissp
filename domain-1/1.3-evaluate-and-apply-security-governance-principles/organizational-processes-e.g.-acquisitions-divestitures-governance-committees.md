# Organizational processes (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, governance committees)

To support the information security strategy and to meet the goals and objectives, organizational processes need to be aligned with the mission.&#x20;

Such processes include defining the roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved with effective implementation and day-to-day management; establishing monitoring mechanisms that include reporting, review, and approval processes, and ensuring that management support is available to such organizational processes.

**Mergers and Acquisitions -** Think of it this way: your company didn’t acquire only the business assets of that other company it just purchased; it also acquired its security program and all the baggage that may come with it.

**Divestitures -** A divestiture, on the other hand, is when your company sells off (or otherwise gets rid of) a part of itself. There are many reasons why a company may want to divest itself of a business asset, such as having a business unit that is not profitable or no longer well aligned with the overarching strategy

**Governance Committees -** A governance committee is a standing body whose purpose is to review the structures and practices of the organization and report its findings to the board of directors

* **On-Site Assessment** - Visit the site of the organization to interview personnel and observe their operating habits.&#x20;
* **Document Exchange and Review -** Investigate the means by which datasets and documentation are exchanged as well as the formal processes by which they perform assessments and reviews.&#x20;
* **Process/Policy Review -** Request copies of their security policies, processes/procedures, and documentation of incidents and responses for review.&#x20;
* **Third-Party Audit -** Having an independent third-party auditor, as defined by the American -Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), can provide an unbiased review of an entity’s security infrastructure, based on Service Organization Control (SOC) reports.&#x20;
