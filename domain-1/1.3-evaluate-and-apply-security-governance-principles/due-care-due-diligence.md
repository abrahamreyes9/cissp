# Due Care/Due Diligence

**Due care** is the base level of protection that a reasonable person takes to check a piece of code. If this is not done, there are potential liability issues. **Due diligence** is the process followed to ensure that an organization is exercising its duty of care.

It is important that intent and management support for information security programs is visible across the organization to investors and customers. Hence, an organization should demonstrate due diligence and due care pertaining to information security processes and activities.&#x20;

Understanding risk and estimating the same, in view of the organization's mission, prevailing threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks, and legal, and regulatory compliance, form a part of the due diligence process by the management.&#x20;

Implementing security governance by way of organizational processes, defining roles and responsibilities, establishing risk management processes, and monitoring the effectiveness of the information security controls are due care activities by the management

**Negligence** (and gross negligence) is the opposite of **Due Care**.&#x20;

* If a system under your control is compromised and you can prove you did your Due Care, you are most likely not liable.&#x20;
* If a system under your control is compromised and you did NOT perform Due Care, you are most likely liable

* **Due diligence** ensures those steps are carried out
* **Due diligence** is the act of gathering the necessary information so the best decision-making activities can take place. Before a company purchases another company, it should carry out due diligence activities so that the purchasing company does not have any “surprises” down the road.
* **Due care** pertains to acting responsibly and “doing the right thing.” It is a legal term that defines the standards of performance that can be expected, either by contract or by implication, in the execution of a particular task.&#x20;
* **Due care** ensures that a minimal level of protection is in place in accordance with the best practice in the industry.
* **Due care** is taking reasonable steps to protect the interest of the organization

**Responsibility** generally refers to the obligations and expected actions and behaviors of a particular party. An obligation may have a defined set of specific actions that are required, or a more general and open approach, which enables the party to decide how it will fulfill the particular obligation. Accountability refers to the ability to hold a party responsible for certain actions or inaction

**Proximate cause** is an act or omission that naturally and directly produces a consequence. It is the superficial or obvious cause for an occurrence. It refers to a cause that leads directly, or in an unbroken sequence, to a particular result. It can be seen as an element of negligence in a court of law

**Example**

Microsoft releases the patch and those patches are tested and verified in the test environment before being updated in the production is a **DUE DILIGENCE**. (Experienced Man rule).&#x20;

Once these patches are tested successfully and are now ready to be deployed on production and that successful deployment is **DUE CARE** (Prudent Man Rule)&#x20;

The implementation of controls is due care, and verification of those controls being implemented is due diligence.
