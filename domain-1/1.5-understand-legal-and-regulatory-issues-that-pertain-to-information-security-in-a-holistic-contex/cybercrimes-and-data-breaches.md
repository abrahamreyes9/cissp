# Cybercrimes and data breaches

## Cybercrimes

The definition of what constitutes a cybercrime varies by country, but in general, cybercrime is a violation of a law, statute, or regulation that is perpetrated using or targeting computers, networks, or other related technologies.

A computer crime is a fraudulent activity that is perpetrated against computers or IT systems. The motivation could be for financial gain, competitive gain, popularity, fame, or adventure.&#x20;

In computer crime, the term computer refers to the role it plays in different scenarios. Whether the crime is committed against a computer, whether the crime is committed using the computer, whether the computer is incidental in the crime or a combination of all the three.&#x20;

Remember, a CIA compromise or breach will be the end result of a crime

Examples of computer crimes include:

* Hacking
  * Black-hat hackers are people with malicious intent, who compromise computer systems to commit crimes. Such a hacker is called a cracker and malicious hacking activity is termed as cracking.&#x20;
  * White-hat hackers or ethical hackers are people who try to compromise computer systems to discover holes and improve security.&#x20;
  * Grey-hat hackers are ambiguous wherein their actual intention is not known
* Identity theft
  * Identity theft is stealing someone's identity. The intention is to pretend to be someone else to commit fraud. Stealing passwords, login credentials, and credit card information are examples of identity theft.
* Fraud
  * Manipulation of computer records, such as data diddling, salami slicing, or any other techniques, or a deliberate circumvention of computer security systems, such as cracking or unethical hacking for monetary gain, is termed as fraud.
* Propagation of malicious software&#x20;
  * Malware is malicious software that is designed to compromise, damage, or affect the general functioning of computers, gain unauthorized access, collect private, and sensitive information, and/or corrupt the data
    * A computer virus is a malicious program or a malicious code that attaches to files and can spread from one file to another file or from one computer to another computer. Technically, a virus can spread or infect the computer if the user opens the infected file.&#x20;
    * Worms are similar to viruses but are self-replicating and propagating. Generally, worms do not require human intervention of opening an infected file.&#x20;
    * A Trojan horse is malware that hides its identity within a legitimate program. Users are tricked into opening the file containing the malware by way of social engineering.&#x20;
    * Spyware is a malicious code that tracks user actions. Examples of user actions include web browsing patterns, files opened, applications accessed, and so on. Spyware is best explained as snooping software.&#x20;
    * Key loggers are a type of spyware that capture keystrokes and transmit them to an attacker's server. Sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, are captured using keyloggers. Key loggers can be hardware or software.

## Data Breaches

By definition, a data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. It can also be owing to unintentional information disclosure, data leak, or data spill.&#x20;

A data breach can happen owing to hacking (unethical means), organized crimes, negligence in the disposal of media, and so on. A data breach is a security incident, and hence, many jurisdictions have passed data breach notification laws. In the United States, data breach-related laws are categorized as security breach laws. The National Conference of State Legislatures in the United States defines the provisions of such laws as

Data theft, loss, destruction, and access by unauthorized entities have now become the largest concern in the cybersecurity world.&#x20;

Data breaches are now commonplace because the value of sensitive data has motivated sophisticated individuals and gangs to expend a lot of time and resources toward attacking computer systems.

U.S. laws that address data protection requirements, as well as data breach concerns, which include:

* Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HI-TECH) Act&#x20;
* California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)&#x20;
* Economic Espionage Act of 1996&#x20;
* Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999

## Cybercrime & Data Breaches

* Understand the notification requirements placed on organizations that experience a data breach
* California's SB 1386 implemented the first statewide requirement to notify individuals of a breach of their personnel information; all other states eventually followed suit with similar laws
* Currently, federal law only requires notification of individuals when a HIPAA-covered entity breaches their protected health information
* Before an organization expands to other countries, perform due diligence to understand legal systems and what changes might be required to the way that data is handled and secured

In particular, be familiar with:

* Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, a treaty signed by many countries that establish standards for cybercrime policy
* laws about data breaches, including notification requirements.
* In the US, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires notification of a data breach in some cases, such as when the personal health information was not protected as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) law
* The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) applies to insurance and financial organizations; it requires notification to federal regulators, law enforcement agencies, and customers when a data breach occurs.
* Certain states also impose their own requirements concerning data breaches
* the EU and other countries have their own requirements, for instance, the GDPR has very strict data breach notification requirements: A data breach must be reported to the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of its discovery
* Some countries do not have any reporting requirements
