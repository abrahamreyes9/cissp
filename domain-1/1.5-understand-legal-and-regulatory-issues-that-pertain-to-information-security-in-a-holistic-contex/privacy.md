## Privacy

* Many laws include privacy protections for personal data. The EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strong privacy rules that apply to any organization anywhere that stores or processes the personal data of EU residents; these individuals must be told how their data is collected and used, and they must be able to opt out.
* The privacy guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) require organizations to avoid unjustified obstacles to trans-border data flow, set limits to personal data collection, protect personal data with reasonable security and more.
* The EU-US Privacy Shield (formerly the EU-US Safe Harbor agreement) controls data flow from the EU to the United States. The EU has more stringent privacy protections and without the Privacy Shield, personal data flow from the EU to the United States would not be allowed
