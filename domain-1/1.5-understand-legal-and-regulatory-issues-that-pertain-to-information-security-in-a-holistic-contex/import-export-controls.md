# Import/export controls

Many countries closely regulate the movement of technology through their borders. This might be done to protect local industries from external competition, limit the exportation of sensitive technologies (like encryption), or meet other policy goals of a particular nation.&#x20;

Countries have import and export restrictions pertaining to the encryption of data. For example, encryption items specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for military applications, command, control, and intelligence applications are generally controlled based on munitions lists.

As a CISSP, you should be aware of the implications of any import/ export controls in which your organization operates or to which your companyâ€™s employees may travel

Each country has its own specifications when it comes to what is allowed in its borders and what is allowed out.&#x20;

The federal government recognizes that the very same computers and encryption technologies that drive the internet and eCommerce can be extremely powerful tools in the hands of a military force

Two sets of federal regulations governing imports and exports are of particular interest to cybersecurity professionals:&#x20;

* The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) controls the export of items that are specifically designated as military and defense items, including technical information related to those items. The items covered under ITAR appear on a list called the United States Munitions List (USML), maintained in 22 CFR 121.&#x20;
* The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) cover a broader set of items that are designed for commercial use but may have military applications. Items covered by EAR appear on the Commerce Control List (CCL) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Notably, EAR includes an entire category covering information security products.
