# Licensing and Intellectual Property (IP) requirements

Licensing and Intellectual Property Requirements Intellectual property (IP) refers to tangible and intangible creations by individuals or organizations, such as expressions, ideas, inventions, and so on. Intellectual property can be legally protected from use by anyone not authorized to do so.

## Trade secret&#x20;

Confidential information that is proprietary to a company, gives it a competitive advantage in a market space. Trade secrets are legally protected as the property of their owners

This is a formula, design, process, practice, or pattern that is not revealed to others. This is to protect the information being copied and gain a competitive advantage

## Copyright&#x20;

Protections for the rights of creators to control the public distribution, reproduction, display, adaptation, and use of their own original works.&#x20;

These works could include music, video, pictures, books, and even software. Copyright applies to the expression of an idea, not the idea itself.&#x20;

Note that copyright exists at the moment of expression—registration provides legal protection but is not required for ownership, although highly recommended for ownership enforcement.

This is an intellectual property that grants exclusive rights to the creator of the original work, such as deriving financial benefits out of such work, ownership credits, and so on. Others do not have the 'right to copy' such work. Copyright is country-specific.

## Trademark

A word, name, symbol, sound, shape, color, or some combination of these things represents a brand or organization. Trademarks are typically distinguishing marks that are used to identify a company or product

This is a unique symbol or mark that is used by individuals or organizations to uniquely represent a product or a service. Trademark is also used to distinguish from products and services of other entities

## Patent

The legal registration of an invention that provides its creator (or owner if the owner is not the same entity as its creator) with certain protections. These protections include the right of the invention owner/creator to determine who can legally use the invention and under which circumstances

This is a set of exclusive rights granted to the inventor of new, useful, inventive, and industry-applicable inventions. This right excludes others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention. Patents are granted for a specific period of time. A patent is a public document

{% hint style="info" %}
Trade secrets are not normally registered with anyone, unlike copyrights, trademarks, and patents, due to their confidential nature. However, if someone violates another organization’s trade secrets, the entity claiming ownership of the trade secret should be able to prove that it belongs to them
