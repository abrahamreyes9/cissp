# Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering



###

### 3.1

#### Research, implement and manage engineering processes using secure design principles

* Threat modeling
* Least privilege
* Defense in depth
* Secure defaults
* Fail securely
* Separation of Duties (SoD)
* Keep it simple
* Zero Trust
* Privacy by design
* Trust but verify
* Shared responsibility

### 3.2

#### Understand the fundamental concepts of security models (e.g., Biba, Star Model, Bell-LaPadula)

### 3.3

#### Select controls based upon systems security requirements

### 3.4

#### Understand security capabilities of Information Systems (IS) (e.g., memory protection, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), encryption/decryption)

### 3.5

#### Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs, and solution elements

* Client-based systems
* Server-based systems
* Database systems
* Cryptographic systems
* Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
* Cloud-based systems (e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS))
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things (IoT)
* Microservices
* Containerization
* Serverless
* Embedded systems
* High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems
* Edge computing systems
* Virtualized systems

### 3.6

#### Select and determine cryptographic solutions

* Cryptographic life cycle (e.g., keys, algorithm selection)
* Cryptographic methods (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric, elliptic curves, quantum)
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
* Key management practices
* Digital signatures and digital certificates
* Non-repudiation
* Integrity (e.g., hashing)

### 3.7

#### Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks

* Brute force
* Ciphertext only
* Known plaintext
* Frequency analysis
* Chosen ciphertext
* Implementation attacks
* Side-channel
* Fault injection
* Timing
* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
* Pass the hash
* Kerberos exploitation
* Ransomware

### 3.8

#### Apply security principles to site and facility design

### 3.9

#### Design site and facility security controls

* Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities
* Server rooms/data centers
* Media storage facilities
* Evidence storage
* Restricted and work area security
* Utilities and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
* Environmental issues
* Fire prevention, detection, and suppression
* Power (e.g., redundant, backup)
